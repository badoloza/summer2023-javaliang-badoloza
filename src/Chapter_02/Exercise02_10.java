/**
 * a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures
 * of the water.
 *
 * Note: Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms,
 * initial and final temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
 * and
 * energy Q is measured in joules.
